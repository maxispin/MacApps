Last Updated: December 24, 2024

Japo Tyrväinen ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains how MacApps ("Application") handles information

Application operates entirely on your local device and does not require
internet connectivity, user accounts, or registration.

- Personal identification information (name, email, address, phone)
- Device identifiers or unique IDs
- Location data
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Crash reports
- Browsing history
- Financial information
- Health data
- Contacts or calendar data
- Photos, videos, or media files

## Information Accessed Locally

MacApps accesses the following information **locally on your device only**:

### Application Metadata
- **What**: Names of applications in your /Applications folder
- **Why**: To display and process your installed applications
- **Storage**: Not stored; read only during execution

### Bundle Identifiers

- **Why**: To check for existing descriptions and write new ones
- **Storage**: Written to macOS Finder metadata (local only)

## Third-Party Services

### Claude CLI (Anthropic)

MacApps uses Claude CLI to generate application descriptions. When you run
MacApps:

1. Application names and bundle identifiers are sent to Claude CLI
2. Claude CLI processes these locally or via Anthropic's API
3. Generated descriptions are returned to MacApps

**Your use of Claude CLI is governed by Anthropic's Privacy Policy and Terms
of Service.** We recommend reviewing Anthropic's privacy practices at:
https://www.anthropic.com/privacy

**Note**: MacApps does not control how Anthropic handles data sent to Claude CLI.

### macOS System Services

MacApps uses standard macOS system services:

- **Finder (via AppleScript)**: To read and write file comments
- **File System**: To scan the /Applications directory

These are local system services and do not transmit data externally.

## Data Storage

MacApps does not store any data. All information is:

- Read from local files during execution
- Processed in memory
- Written to local Finder metadata
- Discarded when the Application closes

No databases, configuration files, or caches are created by MacApps.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not collect any data. The only external
data transmission occurs through Claude CLI, which is governed by its own
privacy policy.

## Children's Privacy

MacApps does not collect any personal information from anyone, including
children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit data from or
market to children.

## Your Rights
